#GLUTCraft

This is a 3D Game in development which is inspired by Minecraft. It's just for practicing my skills in OpenGL and C language also computer graphics. I put it on Github because I wanted to prove that C language won't mess up a sophisticated game. Also, this introduction is temporary. I would update it later.
